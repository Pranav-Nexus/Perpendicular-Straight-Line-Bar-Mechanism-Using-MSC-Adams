# Perpendicular-Straight-Line-Bar-Mechanism-Using-MSC-Adams
Perpendicular Straight Line Bar Mechanism - In this mechanism, one bar describes  a straight line movement, perpendicular to a reference. ۰ The bars remain parallel all the time.

Problem Statement
Construct a perpendicular straight line bar mechanism with alpha = 29.3 
degrees, beta = 60.7 degrees, BD = CD= ED = FD = 12 cm and OC = EG = 
6cm.

Position Synthesis for Perpendicular Straight-Line Mechanism
1. Assume alpha and beta to be 29.3 and 60.7 degrees respectively. 
2. Assume co = ob = 6cm and bd = cd = 12 cm.
3. Draw ob. From b, at an angle of (360 – alpha – beta)/2 of length 12 cm. 
This is bd.
4. From d draw a circle of radius 12cm. From o construct a line of at angle 
alpha and length oc. Join intersecting point with d.
5. From cd, at d take an angle beta and draw a line of length of length 12cm. 
This is fd.
6. From fd, at d take an angle of alpha and draw a line of length 12cm. This 
is ed.
7. Extend ob and gf to o’b and g’f. 
8. Draw a horizontal line at e. From line e, at e, take an angle of alpha wrt 
the negative x axis and draw a line to intersect o’b at A.
9. Draw a perpendicular from A onto g’f to intersect at H. Join AE a
